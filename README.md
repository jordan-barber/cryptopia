# Cryptopia

<h3 align="center">manage Crypto through the power of JS</h3>

## About

This is the main monorepo of Cryptopia, managed using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). This application has been built using mainly Typescript and Electron, to allow you to easily manage and monitor your Crypto currencies directly from your device using JS.

## Getting started

Cryptopia is primarily Node and Typescript based, so ensure you have the latest versions of Node installed. Further to this we also use `yarn` over `npm`.
